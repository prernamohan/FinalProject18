Game: Magnet Themed Crossword

For the final project I will be coding a Magnet themed crossword.
The crossword will be formatted in the standard format for most crossword.
The crossword will incorporate words based on the people, places, and events at Magnet.
There will be clues given for each row or column in the crossword that corresponds with a word. Based on the clue, the player will have to guess
the word and fill it into the crossword. Once all the boxes of the crossword have been filled in, then the entire crossword will be checked for
correctness. If the crossword is not correct, then the player will be told and given another chance. If the crossword is correct, then the
player wins the game. It should be noted that there is only one crossword that has been pre-programmed, the computer does not generate a random
crossword based on a list of words.

The code for the game should be accessed using the file NewCrosswordCode.py. The file CrosswordCode.py was the version of the code that integrated Pygame but due to some difficulties running Pygame, the code for this project is no longer in that file and is instead in NewCrosswordCode.py. Also, the image that have been uploaded were initally for pygame.
